/**
 * Interface {@code SymbolIcon} handles the display of a symbol.
 * A SymbolIcon can provide several features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It can be used as an <b>icon</b> for buttons, menus, etc. For that purpose,
 * {@code SymbolIcon}
 * implements the {@link Icon} interface.</li>
 * <li>It can be used as an <b>image</b> for precise drawing on score views, whatever the desired
 * scale and display ratio. See {@link #buildImage} and {@link #paintSymbol} methods.</li>
 * <li>It may also be used to <b>train</b> the glyph classifier when we don't have enough "real"
 * glyphs available.</li>
 * <li>It may also be used to convey the <b>reference point</b> of that shape.
 * Most shapes have no reference point, and thus we use their area center, which is the center of
 * their bounding box.
 * However, a few shapes (e.g. clefs to precisely position them on the staff) need a very precise
 * reference center (actually the y ordinate) which is somewhat different from the area center. See
 * {@link #getRefPoint}.</li>
 * </ul>
