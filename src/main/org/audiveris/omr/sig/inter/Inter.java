/**
 * Interface {@code Inter} defines a possible interpretation.
 * <p>
 * Every Inter instance is assigned an <i>intrinsic</i> grade in range [0..1].
 * There usually exist two thresholds on grade value:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Minimum</b> grade: this is the minimum value required to actually create (or keep) any
 * interpretation instance.</li>
 * <li><b>Good</b> grade: this is the value which designates a really reliable interpretation, which
 * could save the need to explore other possible interpretations.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Besides the intrinsic grade, we can generally compute a <i>contextual</i> grade, which augments
 * the intrinsic value by some increment brought by supporting interpretation(s) nearby, depending
 * on the intrinsic grade of the supporting interpretation as well as the quality of the geometric
 * relationship itself.
 * The <i>contextual</i> grade provides a more reliable quality evaluation than the mere
 * <i>intrinsic</i> grade, because it takes the surrounding entities into account.
 * <p>
 * To leave room for potential improvement brought by contextual data, the raw value computed for
 * any intrinsic grade is multiplied by an <i>intrinsicRatio</i>.
